## Neo is an open-source community driven blockchain platform.

Neo is the most feature-complete blockchain platform for building decentralized applications. Neo enables developers to digitize and automate the management of assets through smart contracts. Multi-language support (including C#, Python, Go, TypeScript, and Java) makes it easy for developers to build on the platform in the language they are most comfortable with. Neo also provides powerful native infrastructures such as decentralized storage, oracles, and domain name service, creating a solid foundation for the Next-Gen Internet.
