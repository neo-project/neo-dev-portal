# Smart Contract Framework (C#)

The .NET framework is an encapsulation of the Smart Contract API, which helps .NET programmers obtain the blockchain data, persistent storage data, and NeoVM execution status easily using the classes, methods, and properties of the core Neo module.

Neo.SmartContract.Framework mainly provides the following API methods：

- A series of native contract methods that can be invoked in the smart contract，see [Neo.SmartContract.Framework.Native](../../reference/scapi/framework/native/index.md). 
- Interoperability services layer methods, see [Neo.SmartContract.Framework.Service](../../reference/scapi/framework/services/index.md).
- Methods provided by the framework，see [Neo.SmartContract.Framework](../../reference/scapi/framework/index.md).
